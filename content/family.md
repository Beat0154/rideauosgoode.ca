The Children's Programme was specially developed for boys and girls between the ages of five and fifteen. It was designed to provide children with the physical training, mental discipline, stimulation of learning, mastering of new skills, the challenge and satisfaction of moving up the ranks of a structured belt promotion system, and fun of meeting and socializing with new friends who share a common love: martial arts.

Our Children's programme includes [Karate](/karate) and [JiuJitsu](/jiujitsu). Parents are invited to train alongside their children in any of our [family classes](/schedule).
